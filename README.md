# Code_release
1. We anticipate releasing an arXiv paper and citation examples for Sdirt within a week (today is March 13, 2025). 
2. We will subsequently open-source Sdirt in stages: starting with a demo, followed by the dataset, and then the source code.
3. The source code will be released after our paper is accepted.
