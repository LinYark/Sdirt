**TL;DR:**  
Simulated DP images can address the scarcity of DP-depth paired data but face a domain gap between simulated and real DP data. 
In this work, we propose Sdirt based on ray tracing to to bridge this domain gap!

# Code release schedule
- [X] We anticipate releasing an arXiv paper and citation examples for Sdirt.
- [ ] We will subsequently open-source Sdirt in stages: 
    - [ ] starting with a demo, 
    - [ ] followed by the dataset
    - [ ] the source code.
- [ ] The source code will be released after our paper is accepted.
